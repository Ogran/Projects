Created for Web Games Development, first assignment.

Task was to create a simple Platformer involving tanks shooting at eachother.
Minimum features needed were; Collision, Movement, Sounds, Images and AI controlled enemies.

I'm 100% this code is a mess, I still need to practise doing real OO programming and not my spaghetti crap.
